# OT-AI-Workshops

Examples and resources from my workshops on how occupational therapists can use Generative AI and large language models to reduce admin time, streamline documentation, and improve workflow efficiency.

This repo includes a local, privacy-first example that transforms bullet notes from an assessment into a structured report draft. It runs on your computer without sending client data to the cloud. You can also plug the same output into any LLM if your governance allows.
